# HarmonyHub

Welcome to HarmonyHub!

A random Discord bot with random Discord commands.

## Features

### YouTube Integration

- **/play**: Plays music from YouTube. Accepts a string input, which can be a YouTube link or a search query. The bot "intelligently" handles both cases.
- **/pause**: Pauses the currently playing music.
- **/unpause**: Resumes playback of paused music.
- **/stop**: Stops the music playback entirely.

### ChatGPT Integration

- **/search**: Utilizes GPT 3.5 - Turbo to perform advanced searches.
- **/translate**: Translates text to a specified language. Requires the target language and the content as input.
- **/speech**: Converts text to speech in the desired language. Accepts the target language, the text to be converted, and an option for male or female voice.

### Number Commands

- **/even**: Determines if a given number is even.
- **/odd**: Determines if a given number is odd.

## Setup

To use this bot in your Discord server, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Pet a dog (a not-bald one is recommended).
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `yarn install`.
6. Jump twice in front of your machine.
4. Set up your Discord bot account and obtain the bot token.
5. Update the config.json file - part of the mystery - discover it yourself ðŸ˜ˆ
5. Sync the commands with your brand new (or old, w/e) bot by running `yarn sync`.
5. Run the bot server *as dev mode* `yarn dev` (uses nodemon).
6. Run the bot server *as not dev mode* `yarn start` (god blesses you).
